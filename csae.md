At **SlimSocial for Facebook**, we are committed to providing a safe and respectful environment for all users. Our application serves as a streamlined interface to access Facebook's platform, which has comprehensive policies and systems in place to protect users, including minors, from harmful content and behavior.

### Our Commitment to Child Safety

- **Zero Tolerance for Child Exploitation:** We fully support Facebook's zero-tolerance stance on content that exploits or endangers children. Any such content is strictly prohibited and subject to immediate removal and reporting.

- **Utilization of Facebook's Safety Measures:** Since SlimSocial operates as a wrapper for Facebook, it relies on Facebook's established safety measures, including content moderation, user reporting tools, and cooperation with law enforcement agencies.

If you encounter any content or behavior on Facebook that you believe violates child safety standards, please report it directly through Facebook's reporting tools. Detailed instructions on how to report can be found here: <https://about.meta.com/actions/safety/onlinechildprotection/reporting/>
